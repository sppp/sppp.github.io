    I have tried to optimize counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithm for over an year. <br>
The main focus was to solve Holdem Poker. <br>
Now I completely understand all the bucketing of hand probability distributions and changes in the distribution when new board cards are dealt. <br>
Recently, I tried to write everything in a complex Holdem CFR algorithm by memory and succeeded. <br>
However, it is very hard to write high performance CFR trainer by hand. Some generator is needed and I am looking forward for a proper meta-compiler (like FOG, but modern). <br>
Also, I am trying to approximate a series of turns as one "big turn". <br>
<br>
Anyway, I realized, that the self-play training matches 100% to the religious Golden Rule ("treat others as you would like to be treated yourself"). <br>
That seems also match the Code of Hammurabi, the pessimistic version of the Golden Rule ("an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"). <br>
In CFR, the average value is being balanced between players iteratively indirectly (value being "sum(hand_probability * hand_value)" over hand combinations). <br>
<br>
The matching of the poker solving algorithm to those religious rules is very surprising. <br>
<br>
It is actually bad thing, because every aspect of the life shouldn't be a game. <br>
Not even majority of aspects of a life. <br>
The evolution is also not considered to be survivability of the fittest in almost any sense anymore. <br>
There is many complex perspectives to the evolution. <br>
<br>
I think that the Golden Rule is mixed with human rights and altruism incorrectly. <br>
It works positively only in an environment, where participants know what others know and "known knows" are public. <br>
It doesn't work positively with "known unknowns" or "unknown knowns" or "unknown unknowns". <br>
<br>
Thus, I conclude, that the Golden Rule is a very evil rule, not good.
